## 🚧 Philosophy: Rediscovering the Joy of Code

This repository is **not a portfolio**. It is a low-stakes, public code playground dedicated to rediscovering the creative, chaotic, and fun side of programming after a long period of academic burnout.

The focus here is on **curiosity over career**, **visual impact over optimisation**, and **tinkering over architecture**.

This space exists to house small, self-contained experiments that serve no purpose other than to look cool or scratch a coding itch.
